## The journey continues...

So far we have seen many things... Not sure what we've seen? Here is a list!

- Git
- Markdown
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- B.E.M.
- JavaScript

At this point you should understand HTML & CSS well enough to create a stunning website for your clients!
If not... Practice, practice and practice..

> Practice means to perform, over and over again in the face of all obstacles, some act of vision, of faith, of desire. Practice is a means of inviting the perfection desired.

## It's the end of a spooky month

![](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DamagedConcreteIcefish-size_restricted.gif)

No better way to end with a topic that could be your biggest fear, being locked up. That's right, a website for an **Escape room**! You will work together with **_2 other developers_** to reach to end.

That's double the amount of work being done and double the amount of **_git conflicts_**. âš¡ðŸ’€âš¡

To solve this puzzle, prepare your work well. Once again make use of Trello and other tools, for example:

- Canva
- Figma

> ðŸ’¡ Real life Tip: To avoid regular interruptions during your work, have latest 1 team meeting a day to show off the progress that has been made, and to give feedback / ask questions when stuck.

## Design looks easier

The following design looks easier and lighter than the previous Kabibi project, but that does not make it easier!
There are many pages that have to be finished, and we expect a complete project.

![Escapium overview](./resources/backgroundEscapium.png)

## Goals

- Pixel perfect design
- **Everything** responsive (no excuses)
- Have some dynamic components
- **Sass & B.E.M.** usage
- Smooth teamwork
- Solve algorithm

## Animations

You will quickly notice that there are some beautifull animations all over the website. Keep those for last.

The scroll animations can be easily done, by using available libraries. You don't have to re-invent the wheel.

## Pages

In total there 7 pages to realise, I will order all pages by importance. I will document a little about the most important parts. See the design for more information.

Make sure to first create everything statically ready, once the responsive design is done, you can focus on JavaScript.

> ðŸš¨ Important! ðŸš¨ Some parts of the project are having bonuses. We do not want you to work on the bonuses if the webpage is not statically finished + responsive + pixel perfect.
